## Basic Auth Demo

A simple static two-page login demo site created to showcase how Screenly Basic Authentication works.

This project simulates a basic login flow using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the correct credentials are entered:

```
Username: screenly
Password: admin
```

The user is redirected to a success page displaying a demo dashboard layout.

### ⚠️ Note:
This site does not implement real authentication. It is designed for demonstration purposes only. In production, Screenly Basic Auth will handle secure authentication at the player level.

### Features
- Simple login page
- Front-end credential validation
- Success page with placeholder dashboard
